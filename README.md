# Music Player with React

For styling I used:

### React Styled-Components
### Ionic Icons

## Issues

It is possible that on MAC the fonts will look different with spacing
looking "off". I used Arial for my font.

I was not able to modify the position of an input placeholder for Firefox. 
Chrome and Edge worked fine, but not Firefox. I selected it with -moz... and
could change it's color, so the css selector worked, but margin, padding, 
transform didn't not move the placeholder text.
